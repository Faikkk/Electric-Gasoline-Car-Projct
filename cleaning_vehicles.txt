-- Let's start by looking at the description of the table and choosing the columns we need.

SELECT COLUMN_NAME

-- We have 84 columns but we might need only 'comb08', 'combA08', 'cylinders','displ', 'make','model','atvType','evMotor',`phevComb`, 'fuelCost08','fuelCostA08'
	-- comb08 - combined MPG for fuelType1 (Gasoline only MPG)
	-- combA08 - combined MPG for fuelType2 (EV-only MPG for PHEVs)
	-- fuelCost08 - annual fuel cost for fuelType1 ($)
	-- fuelCostA08 - annual fuel cost for fuelType2 ($)
	-- (7) Annual fuel cost is based on 15,000 miles, 55% city driving, and the price of fuel used by the vehicle.
	-- electric - $ per kw-hr of electricity(10)
	-- (10) Fuel prices for E85, LPG, and CNG are from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Alternative Fuel Price Report and are updated quarterly
	-- phevComb - overall efficiency for PHEVs
